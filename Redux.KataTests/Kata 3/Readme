## Explanation

Store can't manage from external point of view de update of a slice.
All update should be done by an action with a payload.
The action start the modification

```cs
record IncrementCounterAction(int numberOfIncrement)
```

The state modification is done by a reducer like this
```cs
class ReduceIncrementCounterAction(int numberOfIncrement) : IReducer{
 public AppState Reduce(AppState state, IAction action){
 }
}
```

## Rules

- Slice are immutable, should be replace
- Modification return the new object
- introduce the store to interact with the state
